\chapter{Sentence Alignment}

\section{Introduction}

The corpus presented in chapter~\ref{chap:compiling} is a raw parallel corpus, that is it is a corpus of aligned documents without any further processing. 
In order to use the corpus for tasks such as training a machine translation model, another processing step is needed: sentence alignment \autocite[55]{koehn2009}.
