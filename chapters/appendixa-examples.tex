\chapter{Algnment Examples}\label{appendix-a}

I would like to shortly compare the  alignments computed by eflomal and SimAlign with my annotations from the gold standard, especially regarding some of the examples I mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:gold-standard-examples} for handling ambiguous cases.

I will consider the following cases: double negation, German preterit vs.~Romansh perfect and composite words.



Below are some examples for word alignment of the different systems. 
Green squares are the gold standard, circels are SimAlign and boxes are eflomal.
