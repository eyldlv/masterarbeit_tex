\chapter{Algnment Examples}\label{appendix-a}

I would like to shortly compare the  alignments computed by eflomal and SimAlign with my annotations from the gold standard, especially regarding some of the examples I mentioned in Chapter~\refnameref{chap:gold-standard} for handling ambiguous cases.
I will consider the following cases: double negation, German preterite and perfect vs.~Romansh perfect and compounds. 
Please refer to Section~\ref{sec:gold-standard-examples} for more details.

In all of the examples below, filled green squares are the gold standard, circels are alignments produced by SimAlign and boxes are alignments produced eflomal. 
The plot were created using a script provided on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cisnlp/simalign/blob/master/scripts/visualize.py}} accompanying SimAlign \autocite{jalili-sabet-etal-2020-simalign}.

\section{Perfect--Perfect}
Figure~\ref{fig:alignment-perfect} shows an example for aligning the German perfect with the Romansh perfect. 
The German and the Romansh auxiliaries \emph{hat} and \emph{ha} should be aligned to each other, as well as the German and the Romansh participles \emph{verabschiedet} and \emph{deliberà}. 
SimAlign's alignment are in accord with the gold standard, while eflomal aligned Romansh \emph{deliberà} to German \emph{hat}, leaving German \emph{verabschiedet} unaligned. However, in another case (Figure \ref{fig:alignment-perfect2}), eflomal correctly aligned the participle to the participle, and SimAlign didn't. 
It would be interesting to test this on a larger scale and see which system is more consistent regarding this.

\section{German Preterite--Romansh Perfect}

In the matter of aligning the German preterite with Romansh perfect, eflomal creates a 1-to-2 alignment, connecting both the auxiliary \emph{han} and the participle \emph{visità} to the German preterite \emph{besichtigten} (Example~\ref{fig:pret1}), an alignment which is not even acceptable, but also desirable, and which I chose to avoid in my annotations. However, in a different case, eflomal failed to align the participle, which is lexically the more important part, and left it unaligned (Example~\ref{fig:pret2}). 
SimAlign successfully aligns the German preterite to the Romansh participle in the first case, but fails as well in the second case.

\section{Double Negation}
I picked two random cases with negation, which are expressed by the words \emph{na ... 
betg} in Romansh. 
In both cases, (Examples~\ref{fig:na-betg1} and \ref{fig:na-betg2}), eflomal aligns \emph{betg} to the German negation \emph{nicht}, which is correct, but also aligns \emph{na} to the German finite verb, which is wrong. 
SimAlign fails in both cases to align any of the negating words to each other.

\label{fig:na-betg2}
\end{figure}

\section{Compounds}
All of the examples here contain German compounds. 
Both eflomal and SimAlign leave the Romansh prepositions connecting the nouns unaligned, which is correct and desirable.
